# MNIST_Handwritten-Digit-_Recognistion_
A Deep neural network model to recognize hand written digits

The project was implemented using MNIST Dataset. Keras
over TensorFlow backend was used to train and save the
model and then using OpenCV the images were processed and
used for predicting the handwritten digit.
